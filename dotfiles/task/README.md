# Task

Go-Task provides a neat cli-based interface to call pre-written scripts.

This folder (./taskfiles) contains the _global_ taskfile configuration.

The [Taskfile](../../Taskfile.yaml) at the repo root is the local taskfile for this repository.

These tasks assume that your system has been configured with `sysconfig` and that the [script bin](../../bin/) has been added to your path via `~/.zshrc`.
